Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to the Official Hosting Guide for Tox Mod!
In this section you will find information on how to set up the
Bot and Web Server in our own environment, locally, on Heroku
or really anywhere you want to host it ðŸ˜³

Before we proceed you should pick your method of hosting the
Bot and Webserver, we personally recommend [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

Once you have decided on a method of hosting download or fork the latest version of the code from our 
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Tox-Mod/ToxModBot/releases) to a folder or directory of your choice

Once you have the files needed downloaded you can continue the setup by following:
