Hey everyone üëã Just a quick little update!

As many of you may know since the release of Tox Mod v2
it has faced various issues, inconsistencies and downtime's
I am doing what I can to get the bot back to fully functioning
order and will keep doing so indefinitely.

During the past few weeks i have decided that within the next few days
I will be making the bot and website open-source to hopefully get some
feedback and well needed critiscism from the Discord Dev Community!

The current and original version of Tox Mod will remain active and continue
to be maintained on a some what regular basis. Until eventually it is updated
to `v13` of `Discord.JS`!
